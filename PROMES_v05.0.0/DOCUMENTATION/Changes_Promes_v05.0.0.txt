CHANGES IN PROMES v05.0.0, compared to PROMES v04.3
(see also Manual)

ADDED OPTIONS:
- Smolyak algorithm added (uses code by Rafa Valero);
- complete Chebyshev polynomials with Time Iteration added;
- allow for anisotropic complete polynomials (ie. asymmetric polynomials).

PERFORMANCE CHANGES:
- Time Iteration: default tolerance diff_tol changed to 1e-8 (was 1e-6);
- Time Iteration: changed step_acc to 0.1 in solve_proj (was 0.01);
- complete polynomials: construction of polynomial more efficient;
- splines: default interpolation method changed to 'spline' (was 'cubic');
- default GRID parameters for algorithms added.

OTHER RELEVANT CHANGES:
- Algorithms: algorithm set in POL.algo (was POL.sol_meth);
- Algorithms: names changed (also now 8 options, was 5 options);
- prepgrid: function name changed (was prep_grid);
- prepgrid: input arguments changed;
- grid functions: several names of functions, and arguments changed;
- GRID: several fields changed or added. Most important changes: XX_poly (was XX) and XX_poly_dw (was XX_dw),  poly_elem added;
- get_pol_var: input spec_opt changed (values 'ini_grid' & 'old_pol' instead of 1 & 2);
- get_pol_var: requires field GRID.poly_elem for compl. polynomials;
- solve_proj: fourth input argument changed to options (was opt_display). Options now determines optimoptions for fsolve and lsqnonlin.
